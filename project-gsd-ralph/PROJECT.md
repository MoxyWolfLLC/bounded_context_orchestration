# GSD Ralph

**Created:** 2026-01-19T00:00:00Z
**Status:** Active

## Vision

### Ultimate Outcome
A comprehensive research synthesis documenting why and how the Get Shit Done (GSD) framework and Ralph Loop pattern should be integrated as the canonical approach for orchestrating multi-skill workflows. The deliverable will articulate the "why" (importance, benefits) and position this integration as the "go-to" standard for chaining skills together in complex Claude systems.

### Primary Stakeholder
Developers and architects building complex Claude systems who face context window exhaustion. Secondary stakeholders include the broader AI agent community, researchers studying LLM orchestration patterns, and MoxyWolf clients implementing multi-phase workflows.

### Problem Statement
Complex AI workflows that chain multiple skills, prompts, and phases together inevitably exhaust the context window, causing loss of state, degraded performance, and incomplete task execution. There's no established, documented framework for preventing context exhaustion while maintaining coherent multi-phase orchestration.

## Constraints

### Technical
Must work within Claude's architecture (context window limits, tool calling patterns, file-based persistence, skill invocation system).

### Timeline
Flexible - no hard deadline. Quality and thoroughness over speed.

### Budget
No constraints.

### Brand/Voice
**Style:** MoxyWolf
- Anchored Boldness: "We don't hedge. We iterate."
- Recursive Precision: "Every insight echoes."
- Human-authentic writing (anti-AI patterns)
- Typographer's quotes, no em-dashes
- See moxywolf skill for full guidelines

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done
This project is DONE when:
1. Full peer-review-worthy academic paper documenting GSD + Ralph Loop integration (theory, methodology, evidence)
2. Complete skill suite created (all necessary skills, prompts, templates) implementing the framework
3. Comprehensive documentation (READMEs, usage guides, examples) enabling adoption

### Definition of Success
This project is SUCCESSFUL when:
1. Academic paper is publication-ready and submitted to ResearchGate
2. All supporting files (skills, templates, prompts) are attached and functional
3. Framework is self-demonstrating (the paper itself was created using the GSD + Ralph Loop methodology it describes)
